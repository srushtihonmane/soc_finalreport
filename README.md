# SOC 2025 – End-Term Report

## Project Title: Introduction to AI / ML  
**Student:** Srushti Honmane  
**Program:** Summer of Code (SOC 2025)  
**Duration:** Week 1 to Week 8  
**Mentors:** Rahul Kumar, Harshavardhan Thorat

## Abstract  
This project provided a structured and practical introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I began by strengthening Python fundamentals and data handling, and then progressed to machine learning models, visualizations, and an end-to-end chatbot project using NLP. By the end of the program, I was able to confidently work with real-world datasets and implement ML models using Python.
